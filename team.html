			<p>Hi, my name is Cory Lefebvre and I'm a third year Biochemistry student. I've been with iGEM for two years now and I'm continuing in my role in graphic design as the head of the division. One of the major projects this year was the production of the children's book for our human practices division in which I helped by organizing and designing the book and its contents. I have a huge interest in cellular and synthetic biology making me a strong supporter of iGEM and its mission.</p>

			<p>Martin Hanzel is starting his first year in Biomedical Science, and is involved in uOttawa's iGEM team as part of his Undergrad Research Scholarship. He works both in the lab and on the computer science team, and is the principal meme creator for iGEM. He thinks highly of his partners and lab mates and is excited to work on such a complex and innovative research project. His hobbies include travel, music, messing with the genetic code of organisms, and speaking in the third person.</p>

			<p>My name is Irene Harmsen. I'm in my third year in the Biomedical Science program, specializing in Neuroscience, which speaks to my great interest and love for science. So far it has been a great experience to be a part of the uOttawa iGEM team and learn all about what synthetic biology has to offer. Outside of iGEM, I conduct research on Parkinson's disease and enjoy triathlon.</p>

			<p>My name is Peter Doan and I am a second year student at the University of Ottawa studying Mechanical Engineering and Computing Technology. This is my first year participating in the iGem team as a member of the dry lab team. With iGem, it has granted me great insight on what synthetic biology is all about. Outside of iGem, I enjoy exploring new things and places.</p>

			<p>I'm Kevin Rutkay, a fourth year Software Engineering student and am a part of the dry lab team. This is my first year on the iGEM team; I found iGEM was a great way to learn more about biology, which is one field that is really missing from my studies. When I'm not staring at a computer, I enjoy photography, baking, and a nice cup of tea.</p>

			<p>Howdy! I'm Richard Beard, and I'm going into my first year of Biomedical Science at the University of Ottawa. Synthetic Biology is redesigning life on Earth, and that's pretty cool. As a member of uOttawa's 2013 iGEM team, I'm trying to learn how to do it!</p>

			<p>My name is Yara Abou-Hamde and I will be starting my third year of university this fall. I am studying Biomedical Science with an Option in Medicinal Chemistry. Science is a huge part of who I am and it has been a truly exceptional experience working in the lab as part of iGEM this year. I learned so much about synthetic biology, scientific research and communication as it relates to a research environment. My colleagues and I have worked incredibly hard and I am grateful for both collective and individual efforts. I look forward to competing and meeting fellow iGEM teams!</p>
