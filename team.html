			<p>My name is Wilson Lam and I am the dearly loved iGEM president. I work in the lab, where I am ridiculed by my fantastic labmates for my chronic tendency to show up late. In fact, we have graphed my arrival time and found that I arrive later to the lab every day, but it's OK since I have a sleep app that justifies my absences. Sometimes I show up early (like, at noon), but it is only because they give out free lunch. I highly respect everybody in my lab and I would never take credit for their work or accomplishments, like filling all the tip boxes or obtaining free licenses of SnapGene. Cool beans.</p>

			<p>My name is Yara Abou-Hamde and I will be starting my third year of university this fall. I am studying Biomedical Science with an Option in Medicinal Chemistry. Science is a huge part of who I am and it has been a truly exceptional experience working in the lab as part of iGEM this year. I learned so much about synthetic biology, scientific research and communication as it relates to a research environment. My colleagues and I have worked incredibly hard and I am grateful for both collective and individual efforts. I look forward to competing and meeting fellow iGEM teams!</p>

			<p>My name is Dylan Siriwardena, however the question of who I am is a much more complicated question. Since it would take far too long for you (the reader) to glean an understanding of my very soul, I shall limit myself to the superficial. I am a third year Biology student, and I am currently working in the wet lab for this year's iGEM team. Being my first year in iGEM, I am excited to be a part of such a large international competition. My interests include rollerblading, history, martial arts, and hair care. I'm hoping to make a living somewhere in the field of Biology.</p>

			<p>Martin Hanzel is starting his first year in Biomedical Science, and is involved in uOttawa's iGEM team as part of his Undergrad Research Scholarship. He works both in the lab and on the computer science team, and is the principal meme creator for iGEM. He thinks highly of his partners and lab mates and is excited to work on such a complex and innovative research project. His hobbies include travel, music, messing with the genetic code of organisms, and speaking in the third person.</p>

			<p>I'm Kevin Rutkay, a fourth year Software Engineering student and am a part of the dry lab team. This is my first year on the iGEM team; I found iGEM was a great way to learn more about biology, which is one field that is really missing from my studies. When I'm not staring at a computer, I enjoy photography, baking, and a nice cup of tea.</p>

			<p>Hi, I'm Mohammed Chamma. I'm studying Mathematical Physics here at uOttawa and I'm going into my third year. In my free time I do lots of coding and software development. I'm on the dry lab of the iGEM uOttawa team where I mainly work on an app we're making called "Bricklayer". Having never taken a formal biology course, I joined iGEM in the hopes that I'll learn more about biology and especially DNA. So far it's been great; I've learned a ton and met lots of cool people along the way. I think that everything iGEM is about is great and I can't wait to see more.</p>

			<p>Hi, I am Nicholas, and I am currently a student enrolled in Software Engineering at the University of Ottawa. Having pursued three years of undergraduate studies in bio pharmaceutical sciences, I have acquired the knowledge to understand the chemistry behind the biological systems that surround us. I am very excited and feel very privileged to be able to help compute and predict the biological systems of tomorrow. The University of Ottawa Igem team is a wonderful team where breathes innovation and forward thinking!</p>

			<p>Hi, my name is Cory Lefebvre and I'm a third year Biochemistry student. I've been with iGEM for two years now and I'm continuing in my role in graphic design as the head of the division. One of the major projects this year was the production of the children's book for our human practices division in which I helped by organizing and designing the book and its contents. I have a huge interest in cellular and synthetic biology making me a strong supporter of iGEM and its mission.</p>
